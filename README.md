**C Project Template**

This is a basic template for a C project. It includes common directory structure and some essential files to get you started.

**Directory Structure:**

- `build.zig` (if applicable): Build script using Zig language (optional)
- `include`: Contains header files for the project.
    - `macros.h`: Defines macros and utility functions.
    - `stb_ds.h` (if applicable): Likely includes header for a third-party library called stb_ds (Simple Text Based Data Structures).
    - `typedef.h`: Defines custom typedefs for the project.
- `lib`: Contains source code for reusable libraries.
    - `ds.c`: Implementation file for the data structures library (likely using `stb_ds.h`).
    - `ds.o`: Compiled object file for `ds.c`.
    - `macros.c` (**potential duplicate**): Might be a duplicate of `include/macros.h` or could contain implementation for functions defined in `macros.h`.
- `LICENSE`: License file specifying the terms of use for the project.
- `Makefile` (if applicable): Build script using Make (optional)
- `README.md`: This file (you can customize it further)
- `src`: Contains the main source code for the project.
    - `main.c`: The main program's source code.
    - `main.o`: Compiled object file for `main.c`.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have a C compiler and build tools installed (e.g., GCC, Clang, Make).
2. **Building the Project:** The build process might depend on the presence of `build.zig` or `Makefile`. Refer to those files for specific instructions (if applicable). Otherwise, you can typically compile individual source files using your C compiler and linker to create an executable.

**Customization:**

- Replace placeholders in the code with your specific project details.
- Add new files and directories as needed for your project's requirements.
- Consider using version control systems like Git for managing code changes.
